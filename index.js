// the z index deals with how different elements of html will overlay each other when styled by css.  This is important with elements that will overlap others like drop down navigation bars.  The z index determines which item will be in front of the other.  Th element has to be positioned with fixed, absolute, sticky, relative, the parent will overlap base on the height, and children take on the z index of the closest parent.

// floats purpose are to position elements within a container.  By floating an image for example you can position it within the container horizontally, saying left or right and the other content will flow around it.  This has been mostly outdated by flexbox and grid, but there are still a few examples of where it can be used.
// It's important to be mindful of what happen

// yes I have used handlebars before.  I like it because it allows me to create dynamic html content.  It's easier read, more organized, and easier manipulate data.  Overall it helps with clarity, and efficiency when using.

// I really like it because it helps with better code organization, more readable syntax, and it's easier manipulate data when using.  Overalll it's just more efficient for developing software.

// progressive rendering is when you have the browser load the webpage in blocks to improve the perceived load time of the web page.  This helps to improve user exprience and engagement by presenting the most useful content first that the user will interact with before loading content or data structures that don't add to the initial viewing experience.  For example with something like gmail you would load the emails first before loading other ui features like chat or notifications.

// css selector specifity helps to 

// using the srcset image tag can benefit the user's overall experience by having the provide the optimal image resolution and size based on the conditions of the user's device.  The browser takes in the conditions 

// data attributes are great for storing local data on the html elements for the javascript to access without the need to use the DOM which can be resource intensive.  Overall it helps with code efficiency and organization when storing data.

// they are all client side ways of storing data, but each one has different uses.  cookies stores smaller data and sends it to the server, while session storage stores larger data that only lasts until the browser is closed.  Local storage maitnains this even when the browser closes.  It's important for the developer to be aware of what goals they are trying to accomplish when choosing the ways to store the data.

// html 5 helps to provide a robust, standardized web development platform using css, html and javascript.  By using these together we can build rich, responsive websites.

// input type = email, url, number, tel, date, time
//  textarea, select
// they all need name or the server won't know what to do with them

// with flexibile media within a respnsive web design you want the media whcih can be something like an image or video to automatically resize within it's container 
//  to maintain the proper viewing aspect ratio for an optimal viewing experience

// not, and, only but only is not supported on html4 so not great to use right now

// no they are mark up languages, they do not have the computational abiliities define programming languages, and do not have the ability to perform logic handling
// they perform no logic handling, and can not manipulate data
//  they rely on JS for complex functionalities
// they specify what should be done not how
